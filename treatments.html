      There are many different treatment options available for leukemia, many of
      which are similar to other types of cancers, each with their own pros and
      cons, and side effects. Some of these treatment options include;

          <em>Chemotherapy</em>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment-content" id="chemo-content">
          Chemotherapy is a common treatment method against many different types
          of cancer. It is the administration of drugs, often by IV injection or
          pills, which is used to kill cancer cells. This can help reduce tumour
          size, and in the case of leukemia, reducing the amount of leukemia
          cells in circulation in the bodu, making the disease more treatable,
          and hopefully buying the patient many more years if the cancer is
          advanced. The drugs in chemotherapy are designed to kill cells, but
          they are more effective against canceorus cells tha normla healthy
          cells because of the fact that cancer cells are more frequently
          dividing and in stages of mitosis, which means their DNA is more often
          exposed. The drugs damage the DNA and other cell structures, and kill
          the cell. However, just because cancer cells are more susceptible to
          chemotherapy drugs, that does not mean normal healthy cells can't be
          damaged. This is where many of chemotherapy's harmful side effects
          come from. Healthy cells being damaged and killed by chemotherapy
          drugs. Some of these side effects include fatigue, digestive issues,
          loss of appetite, increased infection frequency and severity of
          infections if healthy white blood cells and the immune system is
          affected by the chemicals, and hair loss as hair cells are rapidly
          dividing usually, which makes the chemoâ€™s chemicals unintentionally
          effective against them. Chemotherapy can also affect the nervous
          system, causing tingling and such.

          <em>Targeted Therapy</em>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment-content" id="tar-therapy-content">
          Targeted therapy is another treatment option that uses drugs. It uses
          special kinds of drugs that are able to target specific abnormalities
          found in cancer cells. Blocking these abnormalities can cause cell
          damage and death. However, just like with chemo, there can still be
          come collateral damage, resulting in some side effects including skin
          problems, fevers, fatigue, aching and sore joints, digestive issues,
          and other serious problems that may require additional treatment.

          <em>Radiation Therapy</em>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment-content" id="radi-therapy-content">
          Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy radiation (commonly
          X-rays) to kill cancer cells, and hopefully shrink a tumour. These
          high-energy X-rays are focused onto large masses of cancer cells to
          damage their DNA, and kill them, and once again, cancer cells are more
          vulnerable to this than other types of healthy cells, as they are
          constantly dividing, which means their DNA is more oft exposed,
          meaning that they will be damaged quicker. However, there still can be
          very large amounts of collateral damage to neighbouring areas due to
          radiation therapy, and healthy cells' DNA can easily be damaged,
          controversially leading to increased risks of other types of cancer in
          future, though this can be caught early on, as cancer patients are
          always subject to regular checkups. Now, radiation therapy is
          primarily used to shrink tumours, thougj do recall, leukemia is a
          cancer of the blood. You cannot exactly target large masses of
          leukemia cells and tumours in the blood for you'll find none. Instead,
          radiation therapy for leukemia is only used if the cancer has spread
          to different organs, which may have developed tumours or become
          enlarged, such as the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes.

          <em>Bone Marrow Transplant</em>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment-content" id="bone-marrow-transplant-content">
          Leukemia is a cancer of the blood, but it is caused by incorrect
          behaviour from the bone marrow. Leukemia is when the bone marrow
          starts overproducing white blood cells, which undergo genetic
          mutations, become dysfunctional, and crowd out other healthy cell
          tyoes, leading to a whole arsenal of nasty symptoms and effects which
          have the potential to damage long-term healthy, as well as short-term
          well-being. So, while leukemia is a cancer of the blood, it is more
          fundamentally a cancer or problem of the bone marrow. A bone marrow
          transplant involves replacing the bone marrow with an acceptable
          donor's. All organ transplants require the patient to go on
          immunosupressant drugs for life following the surgery, as the
          patient's immune system will not recognize the new organ, and hence,
          attack it, damaging it in all sorts of ways, and sometimes causing
          collateral damage. Immunosupressant drugs supress that immune
          response. This is even more complicated with a bone marrow transplant,
          because the new bone marrow is producing "new" white blood cells. The
          patient's body will still have some of its own natural immune strength
          after the procedure excluding the benefits of the transplant, however,
          weak, and however weak it may be, it can attack the new bone marrow,
          not recognizing it. Along with this, the white blood cells produced by
          the new bone marrow will not recognize the rest of the patient's body,
          and the white blood cells produced by the new bone marrow can attack
          the rest of the patient's body, leading to a serious autoimmune
          disorder. So immunosupressant drugs are especially important here, but
          still, supressing the immunes system comes with its own haven of side
          effects and complications.

          Cancer cells naturally develop in the body of everyday for everybody,
          but more oft than nought, specialized immune cells destroy them. A
          tumour grows when this immune response fails, often because the cancer
          mutates in such a way it can "cloak" itself by producing proteins that
          hide them from the immune system. Immunotherapy prevents the cancer
          cells from producing these proteins, making them visible to the immune
          system, allowing it to attack and destroy them. Sometimes,
          immunotherapy comes with flu-like side effects, including chills, a
          cough, fever, fatigue, headache, and other common flu-like symptoms.
          Immunotherapy is a relatively new treatment method.

          CAR-T Cell Therapy involves reengineering immune cells. It is a type
          of immunotherapy. It involves reengineering human T-cells, allowing
          them to detect leukemia and cancer cells. It is a new type of
          treatment, with a common side effect of the engineered T-cells
          releasing to many cytokines, which causes the immune system to
          "overreact," causing various flu-like symptoms including fever, low
          blood pressure, muscle-pains, and other symptoms similar to the flu.
