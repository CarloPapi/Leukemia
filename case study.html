      <div id="case" class="content">
        Hiransh Saloojee is a 4-year-old boy who is about to start kindergarten.
        His mom Susan works as a bank teller, and his father Philip works as an
        auto-mechanic, and neither have had any major health concerns in the
        past, although Hiransh's father did die of lung cancer at the age of 59.
        His parents have noticed that Hirash has been fighting a fever for the
        last two weeks. After a trip to the walk-in, the doctor noticed that
        Hiransh has swelling in his lymph nodes. They have also noticed that he
        is looking unusually pale and has unexplained bruising and red spots on
        his skin. Despite his usual appetite, Hiransh has been losing weight and
        has been complaining about feeling tired all the time. He has also
        complained about his knees and elbows feeling sore, which his parents
        have written off as growing pains.

          Likely Underlying Causes of Symptoms (Related to Leukemia)

        <div id="takeaway">
          <div id="fever-take-away" class="content">
            -Persistent Fever: As the immune system struggles with a high count
            of dysfunctional white blood cells and low count of functional
            cells, increased infection frequency and severity can cause fevers.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="lymph-take-away" class="content">
            -Swollen lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system,
            and one of their jobs is to filter lymphatic fluid of unwanted
            objects, including cancer cells. Leukemic cells can accumulate in
            the lymph nodes, causing them to become large and swollen.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="skin-take-away" class="content">
            -Pale skin: As the red blod cell count, and hence blood oxygen
            count, plummets in the bloodstream, it means the skin is receiving
            less oxygen, causing it to pale.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="bruising-take-away" class="content">
            -Platelets in the blood are responsible for clotting the blood,
            which is useful if there's been an injury. The blood can be clotted
            to stem the flow. A low platelet count makes it difficult for the
            body to clot the blood, making bruising and bleeding much easier, as
            well as causing it to take longer for bleeding to stop. Random
            red/purple spots can also appear if capillaries under the skin burst
            as a result of the low platelet count.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="weight-loss-take-away" class="content">
            -Leukemia can cause unwanted weight loss. The leukemic cells can
            alter the body's metabolic processes, as the leukemia cells compete
            with other, healthy cells for nutrients, causing the body to divert
            resources and energy to them, burning more calories and fat, causing
            weight loss.The leukemia cells can also trigger an inflammatory
            response from the body, which can cause further metabolic changes,
            and hence weight loss.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="fatigue-take-away" class="content">
            -Because of the low numbers of red blood cells, and hence lower
            number of blood oxygen, fatigue can start to occur as oxygen becomes
            scarce.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="bone-take-away" class="content">
            -As an excess of leukemia cells accumulate in the bone marrow, where
            they originate, the bone marrow can expand, leading to bone pain.
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="history-take-away" class="content">
            -While not a symptom of Hiransh, his family history of cancer, even
            not leukemia but lung cancer, drastically increases Hiransh's
            likelihood of developing some form of cancer (assuming his father's
            cancer was a result of genetic mutations, not lifestyle choices.)

            There are different stages and substages of leukemia. Not all of
            leukemia's symptoms were present in Hiransh. A proper diagnosis that
            determines that stage involves many different factors of layers of
            complexities. Proper medical attention would be required to diagnose
            the stage/substage.
