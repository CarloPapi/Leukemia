          What is Leukemia?

          Leukemia is a cancer of the blood caused by a malfunction of the bone
          marrow. Many of the body's blood cells are produced in the bone
          marrow, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
          Leukemia occurs when the bone marrow begin overproducing white blood
          cells, but not ordinary white blood cells. As the cells divide faster
          and faster, their DNA becomes damaged, leading to dysfunctional white
          blood cells that can't do their job, and crowd out other healthy white
          blood cells, and other healthy blood cell types.

              The bone marrow begin to overproduce white blood cells, which are
              mutated due to uncontrolled mitosis and division. The cells are
              dysfunctional, and cannot properly defend the body against
              infection. These mutated white blood cells begin to crowd-out
              healthy white blood cells and other cell types, resulting in a
              deficit of these other cell types in the body. Due the excess
              white blood cells, the bone marrow can expand, putting pressure on
              the rest of the bone, leading to bone pain.

            <th class="row">
              The composition of the blood is greatly affected by leukemia, as
              it is a cancer of the blood. The blood may have very high
              concentrations of excess white blood cells, leukemic cells. These
              white blood cells are often dysfunctional, and cannot carry out
              their normal functions. Along with the excess of mutated white
              blood cells, the blood can also have lower red blood cell counts,
              and hence, lower blood oxygen. There can also be a low blood
              platelet count, which help the blood to clot to stem the blood
              flow of a wound. The lack of platelets in the blood can cause easy
              bleeding, can cause wounds to take longer to heal, unexpected and
              easy brusing, and capillaries to burst, leading to spots on the
              skin.

            <th class="row">Lymph Nodes</th>
            <th class="row">
              Lymph Nodes are a necessary organ part of the immune system. They
              filter lymphatic fluid, which is drained from different cells and
              tissues in the body, but is not reabsorbed back into the blood
              stream. They filter out debris, bacteria, and even stray cancerous
              cells including leukemia cells. They serve as "hubs" for the
              immune system, and help to produce and mature immune cells. They
              also help the body defend itself against infections. In leukemia,
              the lymph nodes can swell if an excess of leukemia cells build-up
              there, which can also impair their function.

            <th class="row">Spleen</th>
            <th class="row">
              The spleen is another important organ that can be affected by
              leukemia. The spleen filters the blood, stores different blood
              cell types including red blood cells and platelets for times of
              emergency, such as serious wounds and bleeding, and is part of the
              immune response. It helps filter and trap pathogens, and contains
              some immune cells. In leukemia, too many cancerous white blood
              cells can accumulate in the spleen, causing it to swell. The
              spleen can further swell due to increased blood flow which is
              made to transport the excess white blood cells in the bloodstream.

            <th class="row">Liver</th>
            <th class="row">
              The liver can also become enlarged due to the accumulation of
              leukemia cells in it. Further swelling and inflammation can come
              from the increase in frequency and severity of infections, that
              can affect the liver. This can affect the liver's important
              detoxification and metabolic functions.

            <th class="row">
              The skin is affected in many different ways by leukemia, because
              of the quality of blood its recieving. Leukemia can cause
              petechiae to develop on the skin. These are spots purple in colour
              that are caused by capillaries bursting underneath the skin due to
              a lack of platelets in the bloodstream, preventing the blood from
              clotting and causing capillaries to burst. The lack of platelets
              will also cause the skin to bruise and bleed very easily, with
              wounds taking longer to heal. The skin will also appear very pale
              due to the lack of red blood cells, and hence, oxygen, being
              delivered to the skin.

              The extreme concentrations of dysfunctional white blood cells in
              circulation are useless to defend the body. These dysfunctional
              cells crowd-out healthy cells, leading to a lack of them in the
              bloodstream, and this, along with the damage caused to
              immune-response-assisting organs such as the lymph nodes and
              spleen, can seriously compromise the immune response, leading to
              an increase in infection frequency and severity. Some common
              infections may even become life-threatening when usually, they
              aren't.
